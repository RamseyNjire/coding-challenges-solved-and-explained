# Solutions to Coding Challenges with Explanations


> Let's collect as many different solutions for coding challenges as we can! Better yet, let's try to explain them easily!



## ü§ù Contributing

- Contributions are welcome. Fork the project, make changes, then make a pull request.

- If you're going to suggest a new coding challenge to include on the list, then include your solution along with the coding challenge. Make sure your solution is in the appropriate language folder. Include a link to the coding challenge in the top-level README before making your pull request, and make sure it is passing all test cases.

- If you're going to suggest a new solution to a coding challenge that already has an existing solution in the repo, make sure it fulfils at least one of the following:
  - Has better time complexity than the existing solution
  - Has the same time complexity but involves writing less code
  - Is well commented to explain what is going on

- Optionally, consider writing a short article or making an explainer video where you explain how the algorithm works and the thinking process that led you to that particular solution. I am currently trying to do write-ups for all of my solutions to make these algorithms more accessible and would love assistance on the same. You can add your explanation to the any of the EXPLAINER-*.md documents.
