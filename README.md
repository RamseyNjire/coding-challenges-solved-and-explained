## ü§ù Contributing

- Contributions are welcome. Fork the project, make changes, then make a pull request.

- If you're going to suggest a new coding challenge to include on the list, then include your solution along with the coding challenge. Make sure your solution is in the appropriate language folder. Include a link to the coding challenge in the top-level README before making your pull request, and make sure it is passing all test cases.

- If you're going to suggest a new solution to a coding challenge that already has an existing solution in the repo, make sure it fulfils at least one of the following:

  - Has better time complexity than the existing solution
  - Has the same time complexity but involves writing less code
  - Is well commented to explain what is going on

- Optionally, consider writing a short article or making an explainer video where you explain how the algorithm works and the thinking process that led you to that particular solution. I am currently trying to do write-ups for all of my solutions to make these algorithms more accessible and would love assistance on the same. You can add your explanation to the any of the EXPLAINER-\*.md documents.

- To suggest a new challenge to add to the list, add it to the (CHALLENGES.md)[./Challenges/CHALLENGES.md] file with a link to the webpage with the challenge. Ideally, the page should have test cases to verify. In case your challenge does not have test cases, please provide test cases along with your challenge.
