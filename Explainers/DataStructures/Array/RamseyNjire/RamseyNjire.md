# A Short Introduction to the Array Data Structure

> This isn't an original explanation, but is rather based on my understanding of this [video](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures/arrays-OsBSF) on Coursera. I found it to be a very good introduction to the topic, and I thought I might summarize it to make sure I have understood the subject matter. Maybe it might be useful for someone else out there.


Arrays are ubiquitous in computer science, and it's important to get a basic understanding of how the array works as a data structure. It will form a foundation for understanding the linked list in the next article.

An array is defined as a contiguous area of memory consisting of equal sized elements indexed by contiguous integers.

Let's unpack that statement and see what it means...
